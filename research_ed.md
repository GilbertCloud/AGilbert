## Research
### Arctic Cloud Optics Project
In this research project, I evaulated whether improving supercooled liquid cloud optics affects radiation emitted from Arctic clouds using a hierarchy of models. I also developed a process for evaluating the effect of a physics change across a range of model types and scales. This paper for this project is in preparation for journal submission. The most recent presentation of this project was a [poster](/assets/pdfs/ESSS2023_Poster.pdf) at the US CLIVAR Polar Amplification Workshop in January 2024.

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NASA PREFIRE grant.

### Controls on Arctic Warming Project
In this project, I plan to determine how much of the observed Arctic warming trend and variability we can attribute to changes in the winds, mean state, and forcing. The most recent presentation of this project was a [talk](https://youtu.be/C1jKDYqo2l0?si=DreG8EzlVSeKfG-R&t=23067) at the NCAR Polar Climate Working Group Meeting in February 2024.

Funded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Arctic Natural Sciences grant.
